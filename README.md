# TODO
<br>

 Simulate a distributed banking system that allows customers to withdraw or deposit money from multiple branches in the bank. The system is able to process concurrent updates on the same resources (money) in the bank, but a single customer is not allowed to access multiple branches at the same time. Each branch maintains a replica of the money that needs to be consistent with the replicas in other branches. The customer communicates with only a specific branch that has the same unique ID as the customer. Although each customer independently updates a specific replica, the replicas stored in each branch need to reflect all the updates made by the customer.

<br>

In this simulation, the branches are connected to each other and are expected to propagate (via gRPC channels) all **deposit** and **withdraw** transactions from the customers. 
A customer has a unique **ID** which matches a one of the branches in this distributed system. Customers are also allowed to query for a balance (which is expected to be in sync across all branches).

gRPC server and client code have been generated utilizing the protocol buffer compiler and the **banking.proto** file


```
python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. banking.proto
```

<br>


To test run the system, `cd` into the repository directory and run the following command:<br> `python -m main`
